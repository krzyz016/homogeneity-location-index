# The Homogeneity & Location Index : A Statistical Framework for the Classifcation of ordinal categorical data

The objective of this work is to provide tools to be used for the classification of ordinal categorical distributions. To demonstrate how to do it, we propose an *Homogeneity* (**HI**) and *Location* (**LI**) Index to measure the concentration and central value of an ordinal categorical distribution. We also provide a transparent set of criteria that a user can follow to establish if a given *HI*'s value indicates a *"high"* or *"low"* concentration of values around the central value of a distribution. Finally, we provide a *Concentration Index* (**CI**) for the classifcation of nominal categorical variables.

We applied our framework to assess the socioeconomic homogenity of the commonly used [SA3](https://www.abs.gov.au/websitedbs/D3310114.nsf/home/Australian+Statistical+Geography+Standard+(ASGS) Australian Census geography. In particular, we look at the population distribution in the SA3's [IRSD](https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/2033.0.55.001main+features100052011) (Index of Relative Socioeconomic Disadvantage) decile category.

### Description

Conceptually, the **HI**'s value of a distribution (pdf) is a number between 0 (uniform pdf) and 1 (singleton pdf), that is defined as the degree to which the population is concentrated among the set of categories for that area. For example, in the case of the IRSD decile, an HI of zero expresses minimal concentration and occurs when the population is equally distributed among all decile categories (i.e an IRSD decile contains 10% of the population). Conversely, an HI value equals to 1 is attained if the whole population is concentrated in a single decile. In the latter case, there is no variation within the area in that characteristic and the geography is uniquely identified by the central value of the distribution.

The **LI** of a distribution refers to the category which could be considered representative of the entire population in a unit. For example, in the case of the IRSD decile distribution is an integer ranging from 1 (most disadvantaged) to 10 (least disadvantaged).

The formal defintitions and statistical properties of the HI and LI are illustrated in the Additional File of the publication: [Model](https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1186%2Fs12942-018-0162-8/MediaObjects/12942_2018_162_MOESM3_ESM.docx)

### Datasets

The **dataSa3.csv** file contains 330 SA3s and 15 columns:

- **id**: SA3 sequential Identifier
- **SA3_code**: ABS - 2016 SA3's code identifier
- **SA3_name**: SA3's state name
- **State_code**: ABS - 2016 SA3's State code identifier
- **State_name**: SA3's State name
- **Columns (6-15)**: d1,d2,d3,...,di,...,d10.  Number of people in each decile.

ABS: Australian Bureau of Statistics.

### R files

The **hi_li.R** file contains the implementation of the Homogeneity Index (HI) function [*uni.hom*] and the Location Index function [*uni.loc*].

It also includes the following statistical utilities:

- [*uni.conCI*]: computes the convolution of two vectors
- [*uni.corr*]: computes the autocorrelation of a vector
- [*uni.div*]: computes the Divergence Index. It's a variance for ordinal categorical variables.Please refer to [Model](https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1186%2Fs12942-018-0162-8/MediaObjects/12942_2018_162_MOESM3_ESM.docx).

The **create_SA3.R** contains the script to generate a new table with the first 15 columns of *dataSA3.csv* and 4 additional columns:

- **Hom**: The value of the Homogeneity Index - HI 系 [0 1]
- **DI**: The value of the Divergence Index - DI 系 [0 1]
- **LI**: The value of the Location Index - LI 系 {1,2,..,10}
- **CL**: The Homogeneity Classification - CL 系 {A,B,C,D}

**Table 1**. SA3's IRSD HI CLASSIFICATION CRITERIA

| CL  | HI  %           | DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM  |
|:---:|:--------------:|:------------------------:|
|  A  | [68.53 - 100]  | Acceptably Homogeneous   |
|  B  | [57.62 - 68.53)| Marginal Heterogeneity   |
|  C  | [46.62 - 57.62)| Judgement Required       |
|  D  | [0 - 46.62)    | Heterogeneous            |

**HI(s)**: HI's value of **s** *equally populated deciles clustered on s consecutive bins*

| s   | HI(s)  %          | pdf vector  |
|:----|:---------------:|:-----------:|
| 1   | 100             | [**1** , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0]
| 4   | 68.53           | [**1/4** , **1/4** , **1/4** , **1/4** , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0]
| 5   | 57.62           | [**1/5** , **1/5** , **1/5** , **1/5** , **1/5** , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0]
| 6   | 46.62           | [**1/6** , **1/6** , **1/6** , **1/6** , **1/6** , **1/6** , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0]
| 10  | 0               | [**1/10** , **1/10** , **1/10** , **1/10** , **1/10** , **1/10** , **1/10** , **1/10** , **1/10** , **1/10**]

**Table 1** shows the partition of the HI's range into four classes. The selection of the breaks among classes is determined by the HI's value of **s** *equally populated deciles clustered on s consecutive bins*. In this case, the parameter **s** sets the smallest interval of categories which contains all the data. Consider for example the value *68.53* (i.e *s = 4,  HI(4) = 68.53*; **Table 2**), then all distributions that have a bigger HI's value (Cl = A) are equivalent to a community whose socioeconomic groups are concentrated in at most four consecutive deciles.

The parameter **s** is also known in the ecological literature as *true diversity*. Clearly, other criteria can be chosen for the identification of homogeneous distributions and there is no definitive or "optimal" HI's threshold value. However, we believe that the specification of *s* can help users to represent the homogenity of a distribution in "picture", and serves as a guide for interpreting dimensionless concentration indicies. For more information about the classifcation criteria and the notion of true diversity, the interested reader can refer to the publication:  [A framework for the identification and classification of homogeneous socioeconomic areas in the analysis of health care variation](https://ij-healthgeographics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12942-018-0162-8), sections *Concentration Index and true diversity* and *Homogeneity Index and true diversity*.

### Dependencies

To run the scripts the following software requirements apply:

- R version 3.3.2 or later version
- library: *data.table* to read the dataset

### Usage

Run the **hi_li.R** script to save the functions in the Global Environment Scope of the working directory. Then, place the **create_SA3.R** and the **dataSa3.csv** file in the working directory and run in the R console the **create_SA3.R** script. The output **SA3db.csv** is a  330 x 20 table.

Feel free to use the **hi_li.R** library to classify your categorical dataset. Enjoy :blush: !
