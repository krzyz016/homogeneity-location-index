I welcome contributions to the **hi_li.R** library. To submit a contribution:

- 1. Fork the repository and make your changes
- 2. Submit a pull request.

## How to make changes

Before you submit a pull request, please do the following:

- Add an entry to [NEWS](./NEWS.md) concisely describing what you changed
- If appropriate, add unit tests in the *tests/directory*

Doing these things will make it easier for me to evaluate your pull request. Even so, I may still decide to modify your code or even not merge at all. Factors that may prevent me from merging the pull request include:

- Adding a feature that I do not consider relevant for this library
- Is hard to understand
- Is hard to maintain in the future
- Is computationally expensive
- Is not intuitive

I will try to be responsive and provide feedback in case I decide not to merge your request or need clarifications.

## Filling issues

If you find a bug in the library, please provide as much relevant information as you can, and include a minimal reproducible example if possible.
